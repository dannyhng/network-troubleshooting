# Troubleshooting Interface and Cable Issues (Cisco Networks)

A step-by-step guide to help you troubleshoot Layer 1 (Physical Layer) issues commonly found in Cisco environments. This is ideal for CCNA prep or real-world problem-solving.

---

## Common Media Issues

Typical causes for Layer 1 (physical layer) network issues:

- Disconnected cables or devices powered off

- EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) from nearby motors or devices

- Cable strain or poor management â€” e.g., RJ-45 connectors under stress

- New applications that introduce unusual traffic patterns

- Half-duplex mismatches, especially with older switches or NICs

## Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Guide

Use these CLI commands:

## Check Interface Status

```bash
show interface
```

Check if the interface is up/down, and look for noise/errors/collisions.
```bash
show interface status
```

Shows whether the port is connected, notconnect, or err-disabled.

## Check Speed and Duplex Mismatches

```bash
show interface status
```

Inspect the Duplex and Speed columns. Mismatches often lead to errors or late collisions.

Example Output:
```bash
Port      Name     Status    Vlan   Duplex  Speed   Type
Fa0/1              connected  1      full    100     10/100BaseTX
```
Ensure both ends are either manually set the same or both set to auto for negotiation.

## Summary

- Always start with show interface and show interface status

- Physically inspect cables and ports

- Remove EMI sources and avoid cable bending

- Match duplex and speed settings
